                    Hello global citizens! My name is Nivedita Nagar (also known as Nivi) and I'm switchig my career to programming. I graduated
                    with a Psychology degree and wanted to become a neuropsychologist.
                    <br> Unfortunately, there were no jobs available for me. I got tired of waiting for an opportunity so I took
                    matters into my own hands.
                    <br> The result?... Here I am in this bootcamp trying to learn this mystery (at least for now) called coding.
                    <br> For the next three months I will have to eat, breathe, walk, and talk coding. It is true what they say...you
                    must believe in yourself. Once this bootcamp is over and I secure a job, I can get back to doing my most
                    beloved hobbies. If you want to know what I like doing on the side then let me tell you what exactly
                    are my hobbies.
                    <br> I love to read, go to the movies, and hanging out with friends/family. I'm a major movie addict and
                    all though I love all genres, my favorite has to be action adventure.
                </p>
